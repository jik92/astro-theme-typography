When you go out of the airport, you should be apply for your GNIB card in the local INNS.

It is difficult to successfuly apply for appoinment,  you can try to click when it is 10AM or 2PM, maybe have a higher probability of success.

if you successfuly completed your all of applications, you would get your GNIB card one week later.
